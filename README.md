# Newbird
I am a new-bird.

17.01.2019:
It's hard to thinking that i'am still a newBird even passed two years since I know GitHub.
And this is also a vacant period for my coding.
From now on, I need more active in GitHub.

After create a new branch,I need merge it to master.

actually,I think github is a good palce to share, but sometimes I don't know how to use it more effective.

The first step is record the connecting between PC and github.com:
1)setup git in your PC 
    a)setting git config(git config --global user.name/email "") :it's better to keep the same with github
    b)generating public key(ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email") in your PC
    c)add your ssh key that generated in b) in guthub.com
2)downlaod code from github to PC.
