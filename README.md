# Newbird
I am a new-bird.

17.01.2019:
It's hard to thinking that i'am still a newBird even passed two years since I know GitHub.
And this is also a vacant period for my coding.
From now on, I need more active in GitHub.

<<<<<<< HEAD
After create a new branch,I need merge it to master.
=======
I create a new branch,named dev.
<<<<<<< HEAD
>>>>>>> Update README.md
=======

actually,I think github is a good palce to share, but sometimes I don't know how to use it more effective.

>>>>>>> Update README.md
